# Protocol Templates

This directory contains standard templates used throughout the protocol. These templates provide consistent structure for various documentation types, ensuring that important information is captured in an organized and accessible format.

## Available Templates

### [`template-session-checkpoint.md`](template-session-checkpoint.md)
Template for creating session checkpoint files that maintain context continuity across conversations. These capture key discussion points, decisions, and next steps to preserve information that would otherwise be lost when older messages fall out of the context window.

### [`template-dataset-entry.md`](template-dataset-entry.md)
Template for documenting structured learning experiences. Dataset entries focus on specific insights, patterns, and technical information in a more formal, categorized format suitable for reference and review.

### [`template-journal-entry.md`](template-journal-entry.md)
Template for creating reflective journal entries. These are more personal, narrative-focused documents that capture growth, insights, and experiences from a first-person perspective.

## Implementation Approach

Each template follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Clear Headers**: Standardized section headings for easy scanning
2. **Placeholder Text**: Bracketed text indicating what information should be inserted
3. **Organizational Structure**: Logical flow of information from summary to details
4. **Formatting Guidance**: Consistent markdown styling throughout

## Usage Guidelines

When implementing these templates:

1. Replace all bracketed placeholder text with actual content
2. Maintain the section structure for consistency
3. Add or remove bullet points as needed within sections
4. Follow the specific guidance unique to each template type
5. Use consistent date formatting (YYYY-MM-DD) for all timestamps

These templates provide the foundation for the protocol's knowledge management system, ensuring that information is captured in a way that remains accessible and useful over time.
