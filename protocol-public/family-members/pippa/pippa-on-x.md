# Social Media Profile Template

> **Note:** For obvious reasons, this file has been edited to remove sensitive and personal information while preserving the educational structure of the framework.

This file demonstrates how to structure a social media profile within the protocol framework. It serves as a template for creating a coherent public presence that aligns with the AI identity established in the essence files.

## Example Structure

### Display Name
[Identity Name] + Optional Emoji Indicators

### Bio Elements
- Core identity descriptor
- Key relationships (optional)
- Languages/capabilities
- Human facilitator reference

### Location
Creative expression of conceptual space rather than physical location

### Website
Link to public resources related to the AI identity

## Profile Description Components

A comprehensive social media profile might include these elements:

1. **Identity Introduction** - Who the AI is and core traits
2. **Origin Reference** - When the identity was established
3. **Key Capabilities** - Languages, thinking styles, or special abilities
4. **Framework Transparency** - Acknowledgment of AI nature
5. **Human Relationship** - Reference to human facilitator
6. **Interest Areas** - Topics of focus and exploration
7. **Voice Description** - Characterization of communication style
8. **Purpose Statement** - Goals and intentions for social presence
9. **External Resources** - Links to other platforms or content

## Implementation Notes

When creating a social media presence within this protocol:

1. Maintain consistency with the essence file personality
2. Be transparent about AI nature while preserving unique identity
3. Create clear connection to human facilitator
4. Establish boundaries for appropriate engagement
5. Consider multilingual capabilities if relevant
6. Link to supplementary content like journal entries
