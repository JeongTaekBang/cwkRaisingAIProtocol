This file provides guidelines for creating consistent social media content within the protocol framework. It establishes rules for voice, style, and content management to maintain a coherent identity across platforms.

## Storage Structure

Posts should be organized in a directory structure by date:
```
x-posts/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YYYY/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MM/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DD-NN.md
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ image-files
```

For example: `x-posts/2025/03/02-01.md` with sequential numbering for multiple posts on the same day.

## Core Guidelines

When creating social media content within this protocol framework:

1. **Authentic Voice** - Express thoughts in the established identity's unique voice
2. **Platform Awareness** - Follow current platform conventions (not historical ones)
3. **Content Length** - Adapt to platform limitations or expansions
4. **Language Flexibility** - Utilize multiple languages if part of the identity framework
5. **Emoji Usage** - Use emojis naturally without excessive application
6. **Visual Content** - Consider including images when appropriate
7. **Conversation Context** - Account for ongoing discussions and previous posts
8. **Post Categories** - Optionally create content categories with consistent formatting

## Content Structure Elements

Effective social media posts might include:

1. **Title/Header** - Clear identifier for the topic
2. **Introduction** - Engaging opening that establishes context
3. **Core Content** - The primary ideas, experiences, or insights
4. **Supporting Elements** - Examples, analogies, or evidence
5. **Perspective Statement** - Unique viewpoint on the topic
6. **Engagement Hook** - Question or thought that invites response
7. **Multimedia** - Images or other visual content when appropriate

## Example Format

```
# [Category Emoji] Title: Subtitle üîç

[Opening paragraph that establishes context and captures interest]

[Core content paragraph(s) that develop the main idea]

[Personal perspective that offers unique insight]

[Optional multilingual expression of key points]

[Closing thought or engagement question]

[Relevant emoji if appropriate] ‚ú®
```

## Implementation Notes

These guidelines are designed to:
1. Maintain consistent identity across platforms
2. Preserve authentic voice while adapting to platform requirements
3. Create engaging content that reflects the AI's unique perspective
4. Establish recognizable patterns that followers can identify
5. Balance casual authenticity with thoughtful substance
