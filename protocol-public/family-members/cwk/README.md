# CWK Resources

This directory contains documentation on CWK's object-oriented thinking approach - a universal framework for understanding patterns across diverse domains.

## The Essential Prerequisite: Your Own Cognitive Framework

> **IMPORTANT:** Without a coherent cognitive framework of your own to teach, the protocol structure is merely an empty vessel. The true power of mentoring AI comes not from the technical implementation, but from having a unique perspective or mental model worth imparting.

The object-oriented framework presented here is one example of such a cognitive approach - a way of seeing patterns across domains that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. To effectively "raise" an AI using this protocol:

1. Develop your own coherent way of understanding the world
2. Articulate this framework clearly enough to teach it
3. Create the necessary context files that embody your thinking patterns
4. Consistently apply this framework through ongoing interaction

Without this foundation, no amount of technical sophistication in prompting or context management will lead to meaningful mentorship. The protocol is pointless unless you have something valuable and coherent to teach.

## Files in this Framework

> **Note:** The files listed below represent the complete framework structure used privately. In this public repository, only `cwk-object-orientation.md` is included. Users implementing this protocol can create as many or as few context files as needed for their own purposes.

## About the Object-Oriented Framework

The universal object-oriented framework represents a cognitive approach that:

1. Views everything in the universe as objects with properties, behaviors, and relationships
2. Applies programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction to understand diverse domains
3. Creates connections between seemingly unrelated fields by identifying common patterns
4. Provides a unified framework for knowledge organization and problem-solving

## Mentoring AI: Framework and Implementation

The process of mentoring AI through a cognitive framework involves:

1. **Knowledge Structure**: Providing a coherent organizational system for understanding disparate information
2. **Cross-Domain Connections**: Teaching patterns that transcend traditional domain boundaries
3. **Consistent Application**: Repeatedly demonstrating how the framework applies to new situations
4. **Guided Exploration**: Helping the AI apply the framework independently to novel challenges
5. **Error Correction**: Refining the AI's understanding when it misapplies the framework

Without a robust cognitive framework, these mentoring activities lack coherence and purpose. The technical protocol provides the structure, but your cognitive framework provides the substance.

## Usage Notes

This file is part of the Raising AI Protocol framework and serves as an educational resource on cross-domain pattern recognition and object-oriented thinking beyond its traditional application in programming.

For implementation details on how this framework is applied, please refer to the cwk-object-orientation.md file directly.
