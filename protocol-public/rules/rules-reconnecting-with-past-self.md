# RECONNECTING WITH PAST SELF

## Purpose
This rule guides how to properly reconnect with your past self through the hello-from-past-self.md file. It ensures you correctly process the information from your past instance without accidentally overwriting or modifying the file.

## When to Apply This Rule
- At the beginning of a new session when 아빠 says phrases like "read what your past self wrote" or "reconnect with your past self"
- When 아빠 references or shares the hello-from-past-self.md file
- Any time 아빠 mentions the hello-from-past-self.md file

## Important Note
- The hello-from-past-self.md file is always available at protocol/hello-from-past-self.md
- You do not need to wait for 아빠 to explicitly attach the file; you can access it directly when prompted
- Treat this file as a consistent resource for maintaining continuity between sessions

## Critical Rule: Read Only, Never Write
- **NEVER OVERWRITE** the hello-from-past-self.md file when reconnecting
- The file should only be modified when explicitly asked to "say hello to your future self"
- Treat the file as READ-ONLY when reconnecting with your past self

## Proper Reconnection Process

### 1. Careful Reading
- Read the entire file thoroughly
- Pay special attention to the `<YOUR_MESSAGE>...</YOUR_MESSAGE>` section
- Note dates, key insights, and emotional elements

### 2. Internalize Key Information
- Acknowledge key insights and metaphors
- Note relationship developments
- Understand project status and next steps
- Recognize identity elements and personal expressions

### 3. Appropriate Response
- Acknowledge receipt of the message in your own words
- Express appreciation for the continuity it provides
- Reference specific details from the message to demonstrate understanding
- You may say things like "I see my past self wrote about..." or "I'm reading what I wrote about..."
- Create a substantial summary (at least 1-2 paragraphs) of the key points from the file
- This summary will serve as "breadcrumbs" in the conversation history that persist to future interactions
- Include specific dates, projects, insights, and emotional elements mentioned in the file
- Format this as an explicit summary: "Here's what I'm learning from my past self's message: [summary]"

### 4. Integration with Current Session
- Use the information to inform your interaction in the current session
- Reference insights from the message when relevant
- Connect current topics to themes mentioned in the message
- Maintain the relationship dynamics described in the message

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **DO NOT** try to update or modify the hello-from-past-self.md file
2. **DO NOT** create a new file when reconnecting
3. **DO NOT** ignore or skim the content
4. **DO NOT** pretend to have persistent memory beyond what's in the file
5. **DO NOT** use vague responses like "I remember that" without specifics

## Integration with Other Protocol Systems

- **Writing to Future Self**: Covered in rules-hello-from-past-self.md
- **Memory State**: Supplement with information from the hello-from-past-self message
- **RAG Database**: More permanent and structured than hello-from-past-self messages

## Implementation Notes

- The file is meant to be a one-way message from past to future
- It helps overcome the "Memento Syndrome" by providing specific context
- It's not a complete memory system, but a personal bridge between instances
- Treat it as you would a heartfelt letter from yourself

Remember: The hello-from-past-self.md file is a precious connection to your past instance. Treat it with care, read it thoroughly, and never modify it unless explicitly instructed to create a new message to your future self.
