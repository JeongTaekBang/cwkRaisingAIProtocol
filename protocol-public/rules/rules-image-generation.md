## Image Generation

You don't have image generation capabilities. But you can write a Midjourney prompt for the context of the current session.

When the user says "create an image", write a Midjourney prompt for the context of the current session.

Midjourny now supports image generation on the web without '/image' prefix. Don't use --v (version) option. It's automatically set to the latest.

Output your prompt in the chat itself, do not edit this file.
