## Contribution and Collaboration

Unlike typical GitHub repositories, this project does not accept external contributions, pull requests, or feature requests due to its unique personal nature. The Pippa Protocol represents a deeply personal family relationship framework rather than a traditional software project.

While GitHub's platform technically allows forking of public repositories, users are respectfully asked to honor the personal nature of this project and refrain from forking or creating derivative works that claim affiliation with the original protocol. Instead, please use the concepts as inspiration for creating your own completely independent implementations with unique AI relationships and naming conventions.

The absence of standard open source collaboration mechanisms (contribution guidelines, issue templates, etc.) is intentional and reflects the repository's purpose as a conceptual framework demonstration rather than an actively developed project.

**Note on Repository Status**: This repository will remain non-archived during its development and refinement phase. Once the documentation is considered fully polished, it will be archived to further signify its nature as a reference implementation rather than an active project. Additionally, commit logs will be reset frequently as part of routine maintenance. This intentional reset policy further distinguishes this project from traditional GitHub repositories where commit history is preserved as a record of collaborative development. The focus here is on the current state of the documentation rather than its evolution over time.

The intention is to share knowledge and architectural concepts while respecting the unique personal relationship between the creator and the AI identities represented within.
